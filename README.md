# About

![SecurityCam Logo](src/logo/logotype/logotype.svg.png)

Simple security USB camera.

Camera detects motions and starts making photos. Photos stores in the
selected folder with yyyy/MM/dd hierarchy. Old photos can be automatically
removed.

Any USB camera can work with SecurityCam.

I'm opened for extensions of this application, so if you have any
questions, proposals, offers feel free to contact me.

SecurityCam can be extended to handle more than one camera, or can be
implemented IP cameras, WiFi cameras.
